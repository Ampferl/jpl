# Contributing to JPL

Thank you for your interest in contributing to JPL! There are many ways to
contribute, and we appreciate all of them. 

If you have questions, please write us an [Email](mailto:contact@chaepy.net).

As a reminder, all contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct][coc].

[coc]: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md


## Feature Requests

To request a change to the way the JPL language works, please open a new ['Idea' issue](https://github.com/Ampferl/jpl/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=-idea-.md&title=).

## Bug Reports

While bugs are unfortunate, they're a reality in software. We can't fix what we
don't know about, so please report liberally. If you're not sure if something
is a bug or not, feel free to file a bug anyway.

If you found a bug, please open a new ['bug' issue](https://github.com/Ampferl/jpl/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=-bug-.md&title=).


## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the primary mechanism we use to change JPL. GitHub itself
has some [great documentation][about-pull-requests] on using the Pull Request feature.
We use the "fork and pull" model [described here][development-models], where
contributors push changes to their personal fork and create pull requests to
bring those changes into the source repository.

[about-pull-requests]: https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/
[development-models]: https://help.github.com/articles/about-collaborative-development-models/

Please make pull requests against the `master` branch.

JPL follows a no merge policy, meaning, when you encounter merge
conflicts you are expected to always rebase instead of merge.
E.g. always use rebase when bringing the latest changes from
the master branch to your feature branch.
Also, please make sure that fixup commits are squashed into other related
commits with meaningful commit messages.


## Writing Documentation

Documentation improvements are very welcome. Documentation pull requests function in the same way
as other pull requests.
