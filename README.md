### What can you do with it?
- variables (Strings, Numbers(Int/Float) and Lists)
- if statements (comparisons and locical operations)
- for/while loops (with break and continue)
- functions (with and without return)
- run code files(.jpl)
### How do you start?
First, download the repository with git:`git clone https://github.com/Ampferl/jpl.git`
You also need to download [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/)!


If everything is installed, you can go to the downloaded folder and enter `python3 shell.py` into the console.

Now you can use the programming language!

For Example enter: `print("Hello World")`
